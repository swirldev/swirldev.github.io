Course Network is a system for discovering, distributing, and tracking swirl 
courses. For more information visit http://swirlstats.com/scn/.

## New Swirlify Docs

swirl courses and lessons are structured? There's a new website for swirlify's
documentation which includes other tips for making your own swirl courses. Visit

## New Version of Swirlify with a Shiny App Editor

Swirlify 0.5 includes a new Shiny app featuring swirl question templates and a
specialized text editor for writing swirl lessons. You can get started by 
installing the new version of swirlify:

```
install.packages("swirlify")

# Start a new course with the Shiny app
swirlify("Lesson 1", "My Course")
```

We hope to have more exciting content coming out this summer so stay tuned!
