We're very lucky to have users from every continent on Earth. In the last two years of swirl's development we've had amazing interactions with high school teachers, college professors, and training professionals from around the world who sought to write swirl courses in their mother tongue. Although there's been nothing stopping people from doing this, we haven't felt comfortable supporting languages other than English - that is until today! In the next official release of swirl we plan on fully integrating UTF-8 and and language options for swirl users - that means menus and courses written in whatever language you speak.

However to make this happen we need your help! We're looking for volunteers to translate swirl's menus and swirl courses into languages other than English. We've set up a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/swirldev/translations) that contains instructions about how to translate swirl menus, and has a listing of swirl courses in other languages. We've also set up a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/swirl-translators) to coordinate translation efforts. If you're interested in helping us in our translation efforts please join the Google group, send us a pull request on GitHub.
